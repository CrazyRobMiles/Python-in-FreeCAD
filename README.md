# Python in FreeCAD

All the programs are in the code folder.

```
# Enter the text that you want to encode
secret_text = "Secret"

# Select how many panels you want to produce
no_of_panels = 3

# Set the hole spacing on the decoder panel in mm

hole_x_spacing = 3.0
hole_y_spacing = 3.0

# Set the thickness of each panel in mm
height = 2.0

```
You can configure the program by changing these values at the top of the program. 

Have Fun!
